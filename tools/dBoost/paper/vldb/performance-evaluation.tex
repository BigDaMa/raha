\subsection{Scalability}
\label{sec:performance-evaluation}

%We show in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling} how \dBoost/ scales as the amount of data used to build the models and to test on the models increases.
We measure the total runtime of our system, including the data modeling and outlier detection phases for the Simple Gaussian, Mixtures with 2 Gaussians, and Histograms. 
We used the Intel sensor data set from Section~\ref{sec:intel-lab-data-evaluation} to evaulate the Gaussian and Mixture models, and the CSAIL directory from Section~\ref{sec:csail-directory-evaluation} to evaluate the Histograms. 
We use random sampling to provide training sets of 1 thousand and 10 thousand elements from the Intel dataset to build the data models.
We test them on all 2+ million elements in the dataset.
To provide a more comprehensive study of the scalability of the Histogram model, we replicated the rows of the CSAIL directory to increase the training and test set sizes. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:scaling}, we show the runtime of our prototype. Each line shows a model trained with a different training set size. As shown in the figure, runtime scales linearly as the test set size increases.
Applying additional optimizations such as using a lower-level language or enabling parallism would improve runtime performance to production-ready levels.
