# Data sources

Find data!

*   Measurements
*   Human input (add errors to existing dataset?)
    +   People directories
*   Tweets
    +   Real-time detection of new trends (exclude common words, find peaks)
    +   Spelling mistakes
*   Stock market
*   Medical sensors (heart rate, blood pressure)
*   Computer vision (spam detection)
*   ...

Find more dataset ideas, find datasets matching ideas → All

# TODO

*   Outlier traces (say why something is an outlier) → Zelda
*   Find more features: create a `features` file → Clément
    + Sign
    + Bits of abs(x)
    + Date is a holiday?
    + Weekday vs weekend
    + ...
*   Publish online (GPL) → Clément
*   Literature search → All
    +   Relevant models and algorithms?
        -   Sliding windows (maybe)
        -   Simple outlier detection
            +   Compute a reference distribution and excludes values that don't match
            +   Histograms or fancier distributions instead of Gaussian distributions (work w/ thresholds)
            +   ... → Zelda
        -   Correlations
            +   Conditional probabilities
            +   $\chi^2$
            +   ... → Rachael
        -   ... → All
    +   Evaluation metrics?
        -   Performance
        -   Detection rates on hand-crafted examples

# LATER

+   Streaming / Parallelism
