# Project
* Evaluation method -> Zelda
  + Use sensor data for baseline
  + Csail used for running example
  + Generate data for correlation's detection (movie theater) -> Z/C
  + See if the COORDS data sets can be reused

* Outlier detection
  + Three pass model (statistics, create model, find outliers)
  + Extend pipeline for first pass (generate two statistic elements) -> R, Z
	+ tuple of statistics over every field
	+ mapping of correlations between two fields

# Poster project
