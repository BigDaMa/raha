\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Sensor glitches, data-entry errors, and malicious activities are a few examples of events that can lead to the appearance of outliers in a dataset. If undetected, these values can skew statistics, support invalid conclusions, slow database operations, and cause otherwise avoidable expenses. On the other hand, careful analysis of these values can yield new insight about the data, prevent undesirable events, and generally improve the reliability of the data~\cite{Achour2014}.

Previous literature has generally defined an outlier as ``an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism'' \cite{Hawkins1980}, and has suggested a number of ways to detect and in some cases eliminate suspicious values. Previous approaches to outlier detection include modeling numerical data using Gaussian Mixture Models~\cite{Lu2005,Roberts1994,Roberts1999}, Histogram modeling~\cite{Gebski2007,Sheng2007}, and $k$-nearest neighbors~\cite{Ramaswamy2000}.

Little work, however, has focused on developing generic methods for user-guided outlier detection that work with widely diverse and heterogeneous data stored in typical relational database management systems. The relative inexpressivity of basic SQL types -- integers, strings, and doubles in particular -- might be to blame: strings, for example, can be used to store information as diverse as city names, email addresses, or phone numbers; typically it is the job of application logic to encode the semantically rich domains of these values as one of the basic SQL data types. This paucity of semantic information leaves outlier detection algorithms that run inside of the database with very little information to work with.

This paper presents \dBoost/, a new approach for detecting outliers in highly heterogeneous datasets.
Our tool systematically expands the limited space of SQL types to derive richer information.
This is done automatically, by applying a library of possible transformations (``expansions'') to the values of each column in a table to find rules that are consistent with the bulk of the values that appear in the column.
For example, integers can expanded into dates and times by considering them as Unix timestamps, and into sets of booleans by considering them as bit vectors.
If an expansion of an integer column to a the day of week from a date found that most of the dates reconstructed from an integer column fall on the same day of the week, then values falling on other days might be flagged as suspicious.
As in this example, these expansions  can be used to detect outliers that are difficult or impossible to detect using raw data and provide detailed reports to the user.

Hence, our main contribution is a method that automatically applies expansion rules (type-dependent transformations) to create a set of derived attributes for every tuple. These derived attributes are then processed by several outlier detection models to efficiently learn soft constraints about the individual attributes, and to detect soft functional dependencies \textit{between} derived attributes, enabling multidimensional models to detect of a broad class of data inconsistencies. By extracting numerical or highly structured attributes from unstructured data (for example, by extracting casing information from strings), our method makes it significantly easier to detect inconsistencies that would have escaped sophisticated outlier detection systems.

We designed our system to be both fast and memory efficient; it proceeds in three online passes over the data, keeping no more information than strictly necessary (in general, no more than a few dozen values per field in the database schema). The architecture is parallelizable, the analysis can be distributed over multiple computation nodes, and information can be kept from one run to the next so as to eliminate the first and possibly the second pass.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item We present tuple expansion, a novel method that reconstructs structured and semantically rich information from raw data using a user-extensible library of type-dependent expansion rules.
We also describe a library of broadly applicable expansion rules that have proven useful for flagging outliers in heterogeneous datasets.
\item We show that these expansions can be fed to both single and multi-variate models to accurately detect outliers without making strong assumptions about the original data\footnote{For example, we do not restrict the types used to store the data: we are able to find outliers in textual data}. In addition to typical Gaussian modeling strategies, we present useful criteria to detect outlying values in histograms, and a novel combination of attribute-based partitioning and modeling.
\item We show that tuple expansion rules can be used as a lightweight mechanism to express soft constraints between database columns, and flag rows violating these constraints.
\item We integrate these techniques in an easy-to-use, user-extensible toolkit for outlier detection, \dBoost/, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several synthetic and real-world datasets (including numerical and non-numerical data and homo- and heterogeneous datasets).
Specifically, we show that after tuple-expansion, well-known statistical models are enough to detect many data inconsistencies, whereas these inconsistencies would have remained hidden if expansion had not been applied.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section~\ref{sec:overview} we present an overview of the \dBoost/ framework. We then detail our tuple expansion method in Section~\ref{sec:expansion}, before applying it to outlier detection in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. We evaluate our tool on synthetic and real-world datasets in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, and we describe related work in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}. Finally, we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. % TODO \item We outline directions for future work in Section~\ref{sec:future-work}.
