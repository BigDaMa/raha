10/22 Meeting minutes

* Clement put project on github
* Zelda implemented outlier detection

* Suggestions from Zelda's PI:
  + Switch to mixture of gaussians model
  + 1-D SVMs

* Sliding windows

* 2-stage outlier detection process:
  + 1) Check consistency of individual columns
  + 2) Check consistency of rows given rest of table

* Should we search for foreign keys not explicitly defined by the user?
* Should we search for correlations between tables?
     + This would have significant costs
     + Rely on the DB designer to ensure that tables remove dependencies
     + Hypothesis: If there are no dependencies, unlikely to find correlation.

#TODO:


   * Refactor the framework -- Clement
   * Build statistical model of correlation -- Rachael

      + How do we determine whether 1 point matches the correlation?

   * Look into other correlation methods -- Zelda

      + Mixture of Gaussians
      + 1D SVMs

   * Set up a way to share references -- Rachael
   * Getting data

      + Extract data from twitter -- Zelda 
      + Extract stock market data -- Clement
      + Get unfiltered weather data from France Weather Institute -- Clement
      + Ask Sam about data -- Rachael
