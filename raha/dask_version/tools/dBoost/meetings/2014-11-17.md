Meeting w/ Sam:
  soft functional constraint detection
- apply to outlier detection (not done much)

Use Eugene's dataset
- does it match up with the outliers that Eugene's tool detects? Sometimes sensors go haywire when voltage drops below certain level

Can get access to machines to run big datasets

multi-attribute case is very interesting, has complexity

paper-worthy

usu. integrity constraints are stated up front by someone familiar with business
- automatic detection is interesting

Use as many real datasets as possible

Ask yahoo or google for place-name database

TODO
Can we do multi-pass Gaussian Mixture Models that don't require the entire dataset to be in memory?
We prefer processing data by streaming
How many n-compnoents in GMM to use? Sweep over larger dataset

Zelda: How do GMM work? Can we use subset of data to build model? Can we do stream processing? Can we use something other than max log probability to filter outliers?

Clement: Work on integrating multiple models inside existing framework ASAP. Sliding windows model. 

Rachael: Implement statistical models.
