* LATER

** Research

- [ ] C/R Mixed discrete/continuous models, e.g. different distributions based on value of one field (i.e. report all (low cardinality, high cardinality) columns as correlated)
- [ ] Think about asymmetric features (like email addresses: we don't want to detect things that do not have '@' signs)

** Code

- [ ] ? Properly support multiple models
  - [ ] C Train all models in one pass (instead of one per model)
- [ ] ? Combine outlier reports from multiple models
- [X] C Adjust Gaussian model to use data from statistical analysis
- [ ] Z Add unit tests
- [X] C Look at correlations inside the expansion of a given field (trivial: change combination to product in tupleops)
- [X] C Ensure that there is only one type per column
- [ ] ? Change the outlier reporting strategy to make it easier to report
  outliers
  - [ ] C Use =namedtuple=s

** Paper

- [X] Plots: specify size in inches
- [ ] ? Test using Coords instead of Pearson
- [ ] 3D plots
- [ ] Add light units

* DONE

** Research

- [X] C Create synthetic data set; suggest as new benchmarks in case of non numerical data
- [X] Z Mixture model thresholds
- [X] A Identifying other outlier detection strategies / correlation detection strategies

** Code

- [X] C New features: floats to dates & times, ...
- [X] R Add cardinality to analyzer
- [X] C Create a list of examples
- [X] C New features: email validation
- [X] C Histogram-based correlations
- [X] C Check correlation detection on the Intel dataset
- [X] C Artificial datasets for testing
- [X] C Git email and usernames
