Post-6.830 Project Meeting
Goal: Discuss how to turn project into paper submission
Target: VLDB End of February (Feb 28)
  Have paper / work to present to Sam by end of Jan

Feedback from 6.830 TAs:
I'd suggest spending some time evaluating the comparative effectiveness of your algorithms (comparing them to each other and to existing outlier detection tools).  In order to do this well, you'll probably want access to a dataset which has erroneous/dirty data already labeled.

Other outlier detection tools to evaluate:
+ 

Datasets:
+ Keep Intel data set (outliers are easy to observe; need to properly expand timestamp)
+ How would our tool work on a huge dataset with 100 columns?

Should we port our code to a more efficient language?
+ Julia (doesn't have good tuple processing)
+ C (move bottlenecks in python to C code)
+ Stick with python for the paper

Other tasks:
+ What other methods are there to detect correlations between non-numeric or mixed data?
+ Prune expansion fields; add more fields, allow user to decide what fields to use on dataset
+ GMM thresholding (Zelda)
+ Assymmetric features
+ Integrate plots into build process (Rachael)
